    "## Introduction and Description\n",
    "\n",
    "An **escape room** (also called escape game, puzzle room, exit game, or riddle room) is a collaborative experience where a team of players must discover clues, solve puzzles, and complete tasks across one or more rooms to achieve a defined objective within a limited time frame, often “escaping” from the room [<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1) [<sup>[2]</sup>](#cite_note-2). This format supports teamwork, lateral thinking, and layered puzzle design.\n",
    "\n",
    "You assume the role of a blue-team defender responding to a simulated incident in a facility, and the task to collect and create a report of clues from the incident(s). The **Cyber Escape Room** you will build and run is a **single Python CLI application** that runs a sequence of commands to solve puzzles and collect clues from the rooms. Each room corresponds to a module or concept from the course and simulates a realistic slice of defensive work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why this Escape Room?\n",
    "\n",
    "In real security operations (blue team), defenders face many different tasks:\n",
    "- **Triage logs** to spot brute-force or scanning activity\n",
    "- **Check configurations** for weak or suspicious entries\n",
    "- **Search large dumps** for hidden indicators\n",
    "- **Trace processes** to find how malware moves through a system and reconstruct process trees to detect lateral movement\n",
    "- **Verify findings and report** in a consistent way and sign the report\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This escape room compresses that spectrum into five simplified \"rooms\"  \n",
    "Each room stands for one type of defender task, that cover the **spectrum of blue-team work**:\n",

    "## 2. Project overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you build**: a CLI game `escape.py` that interacts with small provided log files. Your program must run deterministically and be implemented in pure Python, using functions, classes, and the standard built-in string, files and data processing libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables**:\n",
    "- A working repository with code and modules.\n",
    "- A transcript file (`run.txt`) containing all required token lines and evidence: TOKEN[...], EVIDENCE[...], and FINAL_GATE\n",
    "- Tests, types, and linting by Session 6 (minimum checks).\n",
    "- A live demo on Session 7 (last session)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important constraints**:\n",
    "- No external network calls. Use only Python standard libraries (built-in string, file, and data processing).\n",
    "- No hardcoded tokens.\n",
    "- Fail gracefully on malformed input, log warnings rather than crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "5. Malware Lab (`proc_tree.jsonl`)\n",
